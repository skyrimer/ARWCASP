## Project Overview

Despite COVID changing the landscape of crime in the United Kingdom, residential burglaries persist to be a problem with over 250,000 offences in 2024. Police's attempts to combat the crime is challenged by limited resources, budgetary constraints, and the need for strategic allocation of patrol efforts. Throughout our research we have found the Dutch AI predictive policing models resulted in meaningful prevention of high‚Äêimpact crimes via automated patrol guidance as well as focused interventions at crime hotspots produced small but significant decreases in burglary and other property crimes. We have also found historical data of residential burglaries were studies without aiming to predict future ones, and thus police has to rely on CCTV positioning improvements to combat the crime.

Therefore, based on the before-mentioned research and our desire to help tackling burglaries, our group developed a 3-step data-driven tooling that empowers law enforcement with future and prevention focused insights


## Problem Description

- **Domain:** Allocation of police resources to prevent and respond to residential burglary in London, UK.  
- **Research Question:**  
  > How can we best estimate police demand in an automated manner to inform the most effective use of police resources to reduce residential burglary in London (UK)?
- **Objective:**  
  1. Create a predictive model for burglary counts per LSOA for upcoming months 
  2. Develop automated data-driven police routes based on predictions  
  3. Design and implement an interactive dashboard that enables clear and concise presentation of above-mentioned systems for police leadership.

## Project Structure

### üìÅ Root Directory

- **README.md**  
  High-level project overview, problem statement, and setup instructions.

- **requirements.txt**  
  Python dependencies installation list (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).

- **Merge.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook that merges and cleans raw data into `merged_data.parquet`.

- **merged_data.parquet**  
  Consolidated, cleaned dataset for modeling.

- **dashboard.py**  
  Launches the interactive dashboard (Streamlit/Dash) to visualize predictions and routes.

- **Data Description-2.pdf**  
  Detailed schemas and descriptions of all raw data sources.

- **.gitignore**  
  Specifies files/directories to exclude from version control.


### üìÅ `EDA/`

Contains exploratory analysis notebooks, for example:

- **basic_eda.ipynb**  
  Visualizes burglary trends (time series, seasonality) with Matplotlib and Seaborn.


### üìÅ `data/`

Holds manually downloaded raw data:

- Police-recorded crime CSVs (2010‚Äì2025)  
- Shapefiles for LSOAs, wards  
- IMD Excel files (2015, 2019)  
- LSOA code-lookup tables


### üìÅ `data_download_pipeline/`

Automated data-fetch scripts:

- **download_baseline.py**  
  Downloads burglary records via the UK police API.

- **openstreetmapdownload.py**  
  Uses **OSMnx** to fetch POIs and road networks from OpenStreetMap.


### üìÅ `processed_data/`

Stores intermediate cleaned tables (Parquet/CSV) produced by `Merge.ipynb`, ready for feature engineering.


### üìÅ `model/`

Implements the Bayesian spatio-temporal burglary model and training pipeline:

- **model.py**  
  Defines `burglary_model` in Pyro for hierarchical Poisson regression.

- **pipeline.py**  
  Data preparation (`prepare_model_data`), SVI training, and cross-validation routines.

- **train_and_evaluate.py**  
  Wrapper to train on one split, evaluate RMSE/MAE/CRPS, and return results.


### üìÅ `routes/`

Generates optimized patrol routes using predicted hotspots:

- **borough_routes.py**  
  Creates borough-level waypoints and solves a TSP via **NetworKit** heuristics.

- **ward_routes.py**  
  Similar to borough routing but at ward granularity.

- **utils.py**  
  Helper functions for OSMnx boundary processing and edge-cost definitions.


### How It All Fits Together

1. **Data Acquisition**: Run scripts in `data_download_pipeline/` to fetch raw sources.  
2. **Data Merging**: Execute `Merge.ipynb` ‚Üí `merged_data.parquet`.  
3. **Exploration**: Inspect trends in `EDA/basic_eda.ipynb`.  
4. **Feature Engineering**: Use `processed_data/` tables for covariate creation.  
5. **Modeling**: Train & validate Bayesian model in `model/`.  
6. **Routing**: Generate patrol paths under `routes/`.  
7. **Dashboard**: Launch `dashboard.py` for interactive visualization.

## Running the dashboard
To run the dashboard, open up a terminal and run the following command in the root folder of the GitHub:
```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
This will open up your webbrowser with the dashboard running there. For more information about the dashboard see the report.
